Each subscriber can make 15 simultaneous calls.

Total Calls=Subscribers×Calls per Subscriber
Zone 1:10,000×15
Zone 2:15,000×15
Zone 3:5,000×15 
Since Zone 2 has the highest traffic, it will require more channels.

Step 3: Frequency Reuse Strategy
3.1 Choosing an Appropriate Cluster Size (N)
•	In GSM networks, the cluster size (N) is typically 3, 4, 7, or 12.
•	Larger N reduces interference but requires more channels.
•	Smaller N increases capacity but also increases interference.
3.2 Assigning Frequency Bands to Zones
We divide the 10 available channels among the 3 zones proportionally:
1.	Allocate more channels to high-demand zones
o	Zone 2 (highest demand) gets the most channels
o	Zone 1 and Zone 3 share the remaining channels
2.	Frequency Allocation Based on Demand
o	Zone 1: 3 channels
o	Zone 2: 4 channels
o	Zone 3: 3 channels

Step 4: Co-Channel Interference Management
To minimize interference:
1.	Use a Frequency Reuse Pattern (N=3 or 4)
o	Allocate distinct frequencies to adjacent zones.
o	If Zone 1 uses F1, F2, F3, then Zone 2 can use F4, F5, F6, and Zone 3 can use F7, F8, F9.
2.	Dynamic Channel Allocation (DCA)
o	Channels are not permanently assigned to cells.
o	The system dynamically assigns channels based on real-time traffic load.
o	This reduces call drops by ensuring channels are available in high-demand zones.

Step 5: Handover Strategy to Reduce Call Drops
When a user moves between zones, handover mechanisms are used:
•	Hard Handover (2G GSM): Calls switch from one frequency to another.
•	Soft Handover (3G UMTS): The user maintains connections with multiple towers.
Dynamic Channel Allocation Mechanism
•	When traffic increases in Zone 2, extra channels can be borrowed from low-traffic zones like Zone 3.
•	This prevents call drops and optimizes spectrum usage.

Step 6: Final Frequency Reuse Plan
Cluster Structure
Using N = 3 cluster size, the frequency assignment can be:
Cluster Zone	Assigned Frequencies
Zone 1 (25 km)	F1, F2, F3
Zone 2 (30 km)	F4, F5, F6, F10
Zone 3 (15 km)	F7, F8, F9

Conclusion
1.	Efficient Spectrum Utilization:
o	Frequency reuse factor N = 3 or 4 ensures minimal interference and maximum capacity.
2.	Dynamic Channel Allocation:
o	Channels are not fixed but dynamically allocated based on demand.
3.	Call Drop Reduction:
o	Dynamic handover and channel allocation techniques reduce call drops.
